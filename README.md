# The "Doom in Discord" Server
https://youtu.be/EAQFDM5-zLU

## Usage
Think of this as a template/explanation for the actual server used, with plenty of clarifying code comments. Most of this is pretty close to the actual server code, but it's not synced to the live deployment. For security reasons, some sections are changed/omitted.

You can still likely spin this up for yourself if you have `bun`, `ffmpeg`, and [my Chocolate Doom fork](https://github.com/p2r3/chocolate-doomcord). Other dependencies include the `diskusage` npm package, and you might have to manually create a `tmp` directory.

## Contributing
If you spot a bug, ping me on Discord. This repository won't be accepting pull requests - it's just meant to showcase the code that's on the deployed server.
